This repository contains Python implementations of non-traditional optimization techniques, including Genetic Algorithms, Fuzzy Sets, and Neural Networks. These techniques were learned during the course ME60353 – Knowledge Based Systems in Engineering at IIT Kharagpur, taught by Prof. D. K. Pratihar.
