# 1. Introduction  
### **Classical/Crisp Set:-**  

A set is an `unordered` collection of different elements i.e. is a collectoin of objects.  
>Ex.  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set of all positive integers  
>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set of all months in a year

Mathematically, set can be represented as follows,  
$$A = \{~ a,e,i,o,u ~ \}$$

# 2. What is Fuzzy set?  
A Fuzzy set is collection of ordered pairs.  
Mathematically, Fuzzy set is represented as,  
$$A = \left{x,\mu_{S}\left(x\right) \right}$$  


# 3. Fuzzy Operations  
1. Union:-  
Let A and B be fuzzy two set, then  
$$A\cup B = max(\mu_{A}(x),\mu_{B}(x))$$

2. Intersection:-  
Let A and B be fuzzy two set, then  
$$A\cap B = min(\mu_{A}(x),\mu_{B}(x))$$
